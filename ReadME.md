# React Info Site

This project is a simple React info site made using React.js as part of the Scrimba curriculum. The goal was to practice React's structure, learn JSX syntax and style components created for this page. After completing the requirements of the project, I added a personal touch to make the webpage more appealing and better aligned with my style.
